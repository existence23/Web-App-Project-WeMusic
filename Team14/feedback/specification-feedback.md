Project Specification Feedback
==================

Commit graded: 4aff246ac6f3c2836c3241ed56f20b315dd7a211

### The product backlog (10/10)
* A spreadsheet-like format, rather than prose or bulleted lists, would make your backlogs easier to read. You could also look into online tools for generating and tracking work on a project.
* In the future, please add a cost estimate, in hours, for each of the features in your backlog. If the cost estimate is more than 5 or 8 hours or so, consider breaking the feature into smaller work units to improve your ability to track progress on it.

### Data models (9/10)
* Instead of using an `IntegerField` with values 0 or 1 for status, you should use a `BooleanField`
* `Song` will probably need another field to count dislikes.
* It's not clear how song order will be represented in your playlists

### Wireframes or mock-ups (10/10)
